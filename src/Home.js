        VR One World is currently in it's first phase of production. It is a rudimentary
        live chat system in which any user may post into. The objective being that a player
        will be able to connect with another player using the website to play a multiplayer
        Virtual Reality (VR) game, or even just to socialize and chat.
        </p>
        <p>
        Open chat is below. Please follow the rules, and let's try together to
        become the community haven that VR players need.
