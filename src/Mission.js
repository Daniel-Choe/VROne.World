        <p>
        Here, we believe that everyone is equal and are responsible for this One World.
        We all are seeking either love, riches, power, or security. There are even
        unfortunate few that are seeking for things that are unobtainable. Despite the
        differences, we still find ways to share our experiences and connect. Even the most
        opposites of people uncover new looks and feelings of life that they would have
        never known otherwise. And although, we have countless mediums and channels to
        connect to each other, there are still those gaps where, someone like you or I,
        are unable to find someone else to share experiences with. However, this project
        is an attempt to be that light, community, link, or whatever definition befits you,
        to connect people all over the world to each other from all walks of life. So put
        on your headset, stand (or sit) with the rest of us, and play like...
        </p>
        <p> - VR One World.</p>
